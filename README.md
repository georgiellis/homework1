# homework1
First week homework
The goal was to make this website more accessible, while ensuring all the image links and buttons were also working correctly.
Firstly, I ensured that all the heading buttons were working at the top of the page, by correcting the id's for these headings.
Secondly, I fixed all the relative paths to the images so that they were all able to be seen on the page.
Thirdly, I added 'alt' text to all the images so that people using screen readers would also be able to use the website with ease.
